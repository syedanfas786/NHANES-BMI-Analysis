# NHANES BMI Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Body Mass Indices (BMIs) of adult males and females using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The goal is to understand patterns in body composition through various measurements, such as height, weight, and circumferences, while leveraging **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis.

## Key Objectives

- Examine and visualize BMI distributions among adult males and females.
- Analyze correlations and trends using numerical aggregates and scatterplot matrices.
- Compare central tendencies and variations with box-and-whisker plots.
- Investigate the effects of data standardization on the male dataset.
- Highlight differences in body composition between genders to guide future research.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library used for numerical computations and array manipulations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries  for data visualization.

## Getting Started

To replicate or extend the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NHANES-BMI-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd NHANES-BMI-Analysis
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed. If using visualization libraries, install them as well:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. **Run the Analysis**:
   Execute the main analysis script:
   ```bash
   python analysis_script.py
   ```

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis is sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and have used on of my previous tutors github link to navigate.

## Results

The results of the analysis include:

- Histograms visualizing BMI distributions.
- Box-and-whisker plots comparing male and female body measurements.
- Scatterplot matrices illustrating correlations among variables.
- Summary statistics and interpretations regarding body composition differences.
